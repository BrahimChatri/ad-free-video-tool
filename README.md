# Watch Without Ads Tool

This is a simple web application built with Flask, allowing users to input **YouTube video URLs** to watch videos without ads.
The app uses `yt-dlp` to fetch and stream the video content directly ‚Äî providing a smooth, ad-free experience.

## Features

* **Watch Videos Without Ads**: Users can input valid YouTube video URLs to watch videos without interruptions from ads.
* **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Requirements

To run the application, you‚Äôll need the following installed:

* Python 3.12
* Flask
* yt-dlp

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BrahimChatri/ad-free-video-tool.git
cd watch-without-ads
```

### 2. Install dependencies

It‚Äôs recommended to create a virtual environment first.

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate  # if you want to use a virtual environment
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Running the App

Run the Flask development server by executing:

```bash
python api/app.py
```

Then open your browser and visit:

```
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```

## How It Works

1. **Input URL**: The user enters a valid YouTube video URL.
2. **Watch Without Ads**: The application streams the video directly using `yt-dlp`, bypassing all ads and interruptions.

```

## Troubleshooting

### Video URL Not Valid

If the video URL is not recognized, ensure it is a valid **YouTube** link.
Currently, the app only supports YouTube videos.
